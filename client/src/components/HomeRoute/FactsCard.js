            Entrepreneurs’ Courage, Psychological Capital, and Life Satisfaction

            "This study explores the relationships between courage,
            psychological capital (PsyCap), and life satisfaction in the context
            of entrepreneurship. PsyCap is conceptualized and tested as a
            mediator of the relationship between entrepreneurs’ courage and
            their life satisfaction. This is the first study to empirically
            investigate courage, and one of a few studies to apply PsyCap, in
            the entrepreneurial context. Peterson and Seligman (2004) define
            courage as a character strength that promotes the exercise of will
            to achieve goals, even when faced with opposition. </p>

            <p> A courageous
            decision contains an element of risk, the freedom to act, and a
            purposeful outcome (Shelp, 1984; Woodard, 2004; Rate, 2007; Rate et
            al., 2007). Entrepreneurs often deal with plenty of risks and
            uncertainties. Courage can be a critical psychological resource for
            entrepreneurs. Naughton and Cornwall (2006) consider courage to be
            the most important quality for successful entrepreneurs. Without
            courage, an individual may never follow through with an
            entrepreneurial idea or leave the perks and certainties of typical
            employment to pursue entrepreneurship. PsyCap is a higher-order
            construct defined as “an individual’s positive psychological state
            of development and is characterized by: (1) having confidence
            (self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to
            succeed at challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution
            (optimism) about succeeding now and in the future; (3) persevering
            toward goals and, when necessary, redirecting paths to goals (hope)
            in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity,
            sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency) to attain
            success” (Luthans et al., 2015, p. 2). Hope, efficacy, resilience,
            and optimism work together to produce results greater than each of
            the individual resources. The underlying mechanism or common thread
            linking PsyCap’s resources is that they all share a “positive
            appraisal of circumstances and probability for success based on
            motivated effort and perseverance” (Luthans et al., 2007, p. 550).
            Entrepreneurs’ PsyCap is positively related to venture performance
            (Hmieleski and Carr, 2008), authentic leadership (Jensen and
            Luthans, 2006) and wellbeing (Hmieleski and Carr, 2007; Roche et
            al., 2014). Interestingly, entrepreneurs with higher PsyCap have
            been found to experience lower, rather than higher levels of stress
            and anxiety than the average population. This highlights the
            importance of PsyCap in attracting and sustaining entrepreneurship
            efforts (Baron et al., 2016). Entrepreneurial success can take on
            many forms. Financial return is certainly an indicator of success.
            However, an average entrepreneur typically has a lower income than
            fulltime employed counterparts (Hamilton, 2000). Many individuals
            tend to pursue entrepreneurship, not only as a job, but as a
            lifestyle. Entrepreneurship fulfills many social and psychological
            needs. Thus, an entrepreneur’s satisfaction is an important global
            indicator of success. Life satisfaction is defined as “a global
            assessment of a person’s quality of life according to his chosen
            criteria” (Shin and Johnson, 1978, p. 478). Life satisfaction occurs
            when an individual cognitively assesses his or her current life
            against a preconceived subjective standard and believes to have met
            or exceeded that standard (Pavot and Diener, 1993). An individual
            may choose money, prestige, family, or work, as important life
            domains for determining life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985).
            Kim-Prieto et al. (2005) posit that subjective wellbeing is
            determined by positive appraisals and memories. Since venture
            success is subjective to each entrepreneur (Naughton and Cornwall,
            2006), life satisfaction is an important and meaningful
            entrepreneurship outcome. Courage can enhance entrepreneurs’ PsyCap
            in several ways. One of the most effective ways to build PsyCap
            efficacy is through mastery experiences (Bandura, 1997). Courageous
            entrepreneurs are likely to be more confident than their less
            courageous counterparts who never dare to try, take risks, and
            embrace uncertainty to build those valuable experiences. Courage can
            also promote PsyCap hope and optimism. A courageous entrepreneur may
            perceive a risky but feasible path around a setback as a possibility
            with a “can do” and “will do” attitude. Finally, entrepreneurs will
            most likely face adversities and setbacks. Resilient individuals
            function well under environmental stress and uncertainty (Rutter,
            1987; Klohnen, 1996). Thus, courage can promote the PsyCap resources
            of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism, and the following is
            hypothesized. <br />
            <br />
            <bold>Hypothesis 1:</bold><br />
            Entrepreneurs’ Courage Is Positively Related to Their PsyCap
            Research supports a positive relationship between PsyCap and
            satisfaction with various life domains including work, health,
            relationships, and life in general (Luthans et al., 2007; Youssef
            and Luthans, 2007; Avey et al., 2010, 2011; Luthans et al., 2013).
            According to Kim-Prieto et al. (2005), factors that affect one’s
            subjective evaluations of life (i.e., life satisfaction) include
            actual life events, affective reactions to events, selective memory
            and recall, and global evaluations of one’s life in general. Because
            PsyCap involves positive appraisals of one’s circumstances and
            chances of success, individuals with higher levels of PsyCap are
            more likely to experience life satisfaction within life domains.
            Thus, the following is hypothesized. <br />
            <br />
            <bold>Hypothesis 2:</bold><br />
            Entrepreneurs’ PsyCap Is Positively Related to Their Life
            Satisfaction In line with Rate’s (2007) description of courage as
            containing an element of risk, the freedom to act, and a purposeful
            outcome, an entrepreneur who has courage faces the risk(s) involved,
            and exercises the freedom to act and move forward with the venture,
            with an eye toward the desired outcome of a successful and
            fulfilling venture. The entrepreneur’s subjective assessment of
            risk, the freedom to act and the outcome will all affect the
            entrepreneurship venture, and in turn, the entrepreneur’s overall
            life satisfaction. Thus, the following is hypothesized. <br />
            <br />
            <bold>Hypothesis 3:</bold><br />
            Entrepreneurs’ Courage Is Positively Related to Their Life
            Satisfaction Courage can help an individual face the risk and take
            the leap to make the dream a reality. A courageous entrepreneur will
            determine the level of risk associated with the goals for the
            business and possible outcomes. In turn, this courage to start and
            pursue an entrepreneurial venture can help the entrepreneur build
            confidence, find a different path if the initial one is no longer
            viable (hope), persevere and bounce back from setbacks (resilience),
            and maintain a positive outlook (optimism). In turn, PsyCap’s
            positive appraisals and agentic, intentional approach can promote
            satisfaction with the entrepreneurial experience and lifestyle in
            general. In contrast, without PsyCap, the entrepreneur may just give
            up and attribute failure to individual shortcomings, which can lead
            to dissatisfaction. Thus courage can contribute to entrepreneurs’
            life satisfaction, both directly and indirectly through leveraging
            PsyCap, and the following is hypothesized. <br />
            <br />
            <bold>Hypothesis 4:</bold> <br />Entrepreneurs’ PsyCap Mediates the
            Relationship Between Their Courage and Life Satisfaction
